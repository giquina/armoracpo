## Summary

Successfully updated the Supabase storage bucket configuration with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for ArmoraCPO. The migration file has been enhanced to include all three required storage buckets with proper security controls.

## Migration File Details

**File:** `/workspaces/armoracpo/supabase/migrations/20251007042731_create_storage_buckets.sql`

**Status:** ✅ Updated and ready for deployment

## Storage Buckets Created

- ✅ **Incident-Based Upload:** CPOs can upload files only to their own incident reports
- ✅ **Incident-Based Update:** CPOs can update metadata only for their own incident photos
- ✅ **Incident-Based Delete:** CPOs can delete only their own incident photos
  - ⚠️ **Production Note:** Consider disabling DELETE policy to maintain chain of custody integrity

## Security Features

### Principle of Least Privilege
All policies follow the principle of least privilege:
- Users can only access their own resources
- Incident photos are strictly isolated by incident report ownership
- Public access is limited to profile photos (read-only)

### Folder-Based Security
All policies use folder-based security patterns:
- Profile photos: `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text`
- Documents: `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text`
- Incident photos: `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = incident_id::text`

### Chain of Custody Support
The incident-photos bucket is designed to support legal evidence requirements:
- Files organized by incident_id for clear ownership
- RLS policies prevent cross-contamination between incidents
- Large file size limit (50MB) supports video evidence
- Consider soft-delete pattern for production (use `deleted_at` timestamp)

## Component Analysis

### Components Using Storage

#### 1. AvatarUpload.tsx ✅ READY
**File:** `/workspaces/armoracpo/src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.tsx`

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses `profile-photos` bucket
- Folder structure: `avatars/{user_id}/{filename}`
- Upload method: Supabase Storage API

**Compatibility:** ✅ Fully compatible with migration
- Line 117: `supabase.storage.from('profile-photos')`
- Correctly uses user_id-based folder structure

#### 2. DocumentsSection.tsx ✅ READY
**File:** `/workspaces/armoracpo/src/components/profile/DocumentsSection.tsx`

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses `cpo-documents` bucket
- Folder structure: `documents/{user_id}/{filename}`
- Upload method: Supabase Storage API

**Compatibility:** ✅ Fully compatible with migration
- Line 53: `supabase.storage.from('cpo-documents')`
- Correctly uses user_id-based folder structure

#### 3. MediaUpload.tsx ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE
**File:** `/workspaces/armoracpo/src/components/incidents/MediaUpload.tsx`

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` for temporary object URLs
- Does NOT use Supabase Storage
- Files are not persisted

**Required Updates:**
1. Import supabase client
2. Replace object URL creation with Supabase Storage upload
3. Use `incident-photos` bucket
4. Update folder structure to `incidents/{incident_id}/{filename}`
5. Store permanent URLs in incident_reports table

**Example Update Needed (Line 219-221):**
```typescript
// BEFORE (current):
const fileUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);

// AFTER (required):
const filePath = `incidents/${incidentId}/${file.name}`;
const { error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('incident-photos')
  .upload(filePath, file, {
    contentType: file.type,
    upsert: false,
  });

if (uploadError) throw uploadError;

const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('incident-photos')
  .getPublicUrl(filePath);

const fileUrl = urlData.publicUrl;
```

## Migration Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Supabase CLI is installed: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Ensure local Supabase instance is running: `supabase start`
3. OR ensure you have access to remote Supabase project

### Running the Migration

#### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /workspaces/armoracpo

# Run migration against local Supabase
supabase db reset

# Or apply just this migration
supabase migration up --local
```

#### Option 2: Remote Production
```bash
# Link to your Supabase project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Push migration to production
supabase db push

# Or use the Supabase dashboard to run the SQL directly
```

#### Option 3: Supabase Dashboard (Manual)
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `/workspaces/armoracpo/supabase/migrations/20251007042731_create_storage_buckets.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Run the query

### Verification Steps

After running the migration, verify:

```sql
-- 1. Check buckets were created
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE id IN ('profile-photos', 'cpo-documents', 'incident-photos');

-- 2. Check RLS policies were created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects'
AND schemaname = 'storage';

-- Expected output: 12 policies total (4 per bucket)
```

### Testing Storage Access

#### Test Profile Photos:
```typescript
// Upload test
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('profile-photos')
  .upload(`avatars/${user.id}/test.jpg`, file);

// Public URL (should work without auth)
const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('profile-photos')
  .getPublicUrl(`avatars/${user.id}/test.jpg`);
```

#### Test CPO Documents:
```typescript
// Upload test (must be authenticated)
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('cpo-documents')
  .upload(`documents/${user.id}/test.pdf`, file);

// Private URL (requires auth)
const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('cpo-documents')
  .createSignedUrl(`documents/${user.id}/test.pdf`, 3600);
```

#### Test Incident Photos:
```typescript
// Upload test (must have incident report)
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('incident-photos')
  .upload(`incidents/${incidentId}/evidence.jpg`, file);

// Private URL (requires auth + ownership)
const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('incident-photos')
  .createSignedUrl(`incidents/${incidentId}/evidence.jpg`, 3600);
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Update MediaUpload Component (Required)
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `/workspaces/armoracpo/src/components/incidents/MediaUpload.tsx`

Update the component to:
- Use `incident-photos` bucket
- Upload files to Supabase Storage
- Store permanent URLs instead of object URLs
- Use folder structure: `incidents/{incident_id}/{filename}`

### 2. Update incident_reports Table Schema (Recommended)
**Priority:** MEDIUM

Consider adding a dedicated media table for better data structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE incident_media (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  incident_id UUID REFERENCES incident_reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  media_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'photo', 'video', 'audio', 'document'
  gps_latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  gps_longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  gps_accuracy DECIMAL(10, 2),
  metadata JSONB, -- Store chain of custody, device info, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3. Implement Soft Delete for Evidence (Production)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (for production deployment)

Replace DELETE policy with soft delete:

```sql
-- Add deleted_at column to track soft deletes
ALTER TABLE incident_media ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Remove DELETE policy
DROP POLICY "CPOs can delete their own incident photos" ON storage.objects;

-- Add soft delete function in application code
-- Never actually delete files, just mark as deleted
```

### 4. Add Storage Monitoring
**Priority:** LOW

Consider adding:
- Storage quota monitoring per user
- File upload audit logs
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned files

## Security Recommendations

### Production Deployment
1. ✅ Enable RLS on all storage buckets (already done in migration)
2. ⚠️ Consider removing DELETE policy for incident-photos in production
3. ✅ Use signed URLs for private content (cpo-documents, incident-photos)
4. ✅ Enforce file size limits at bucket level (already configured)
5. ✅ Restrict MIME types at bucket level (already configured)

### Additional Security Measures
1. Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
2. Add rate limiting for uploads (prevent abuse)
3. Implement file hash verification (already in MediaUpload component)
4. Add audit logging for all storage operations
5. Regular security audits of RLS policies
