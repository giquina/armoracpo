);

-- Add indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_history_assignment_id ON public.location_history(assignment_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_history_cpo_id ON public.location_history(cpo_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_history_timestamp ON public.location_history(timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_history_assignment_timestamp ON public.location_history(assignment_id, timestamp DESC);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.location_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policy: CPOs can view their own location history
CREATE POLICY "CPOs can view their own location history"
  ON public.location_history
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    cpo_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.protection_officers
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- RLS Policy: CPOs can insert their own location data
CREATE POLICY "CPOs can insert their own location data"
  ON public.location_history
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    cpo_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.protection_officers
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- RLS Policy: Clients can view location history for their assignments
CREATE POLICY "Clients can view location history for their assignments"
  ON public.location_history
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    assignment_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.protection_assignments
      WHERE client_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Add comment to table
COMMENT ON TABLE public.location_history IS 'GPS location tracking data for active protection assignments';

-- Add comments to columns
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.assignment_id IS 'Reference to the active assignment';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.cpo_id IS 'Reference to the protection officer';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.latitude IS 'GPS latitude in decimal degrees';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.longitude IS 'GPS longitude in decimal degrees';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.accuracy IS 'Location accuracy in meters';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.altitude IS 'Altitude in meters (optional)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.heading IS 'Direction of travel in degrees (0-360, optional)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.speed IS 'Speed in meters per second (optional)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.timestamp IS 'When the location was recorded';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.location_history.created_at IS 'When this record was inserted into the database';
```

#### 1.3 Execute the Migration
1. Paste the SQL script into the SQL Editor query panel

You have two options:

**Option A: Redeploy Existing Deployment (Recommended)**
1. Find the latest successful production deployment
2. Click the three-dot menu (**···**) on the right side
3. Select **"Redeploy"**
4. In the modal, ensure **"Use existing Build Cache"** is UNCHECKED (we want fresh build with new env vars)
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

**Option B: Trigger from Git**
1. If you have access to the GitHub repository, push a small change (like updating a comment)
2. Vercel will automatically deploy the new commit

**Recommended:** Use Option A.

#### 5.4 Monitor Deployment Progress
1. After triggering redeployment, you'll be taken to the deployment details page
2. Watch the build logs in real-time
3. Look for the following stages:
   - **Queued** → **Building** → **Deploying** → **Ready**

**Expected Build Time:** 2-5 minutes

**Expected Outcome:** Deployment succeeds and status shows **"Ready"** with a green checkmark.

#### 5.5 Handle Deployment Errors
**If deployment fails, check the logs for common issues:**

| Error Type | Look For | Solution |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Build Error | "npm ERR!" or "Type error" | TypeScript errors - report to dev team |
| Environment Error | "is required" or "undefined" | Missing environment variable - double-check Task 4 |
| Dependency Error | "Cannot find module" | Package.json issue - report to dev team |
| Timeout | "Build exceeded maximum duration" | Try redeploying - may be transient |

**If deployment fails:**
1. Take a screenshot of the error logs
2. Copy the full error message
3. Note the deployment URL
4. Document in Task 5 results
5. Report to development team

#### 5.6 Verify Deployment Success
Once deployment shows "Ready":

1. Click on the deployment URL to open the site
2. The URL should look like: `https://armoracpo-[hash]-giquinas-projects.vercel.app`
3. Wait for the page to load

**Expected Outcome:** The ArmoraCPO splash screen or welcome page loads.

#### 5.7 Basic Functionality Test
1. **Test 1: Service Worker Registration**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to **Application** → **Service Workers**
   - Verify service worker is registered and status is "Activated and is running"

2. **Test 2: Console for Errors**
   - Check the **Console** tab for red errors
   - Ignore warnings (yellow)
   - Note any critical errors related to Sentry, Firebase, or Supabase

3. **Test 3: Environment Variables Loaded**
   - In the Console, type:
     ```javascript
     console.log(window.location.origin)
     ```
   - You should see the Vercel URL
   - Note: You won't be able to see env vars directly (they're build-time only)

**Expected Outcome:** No critical errors in console, service worker active.

### Steps

#### 6.1 Test Sentry Integration
1. Open the deployed site: `https://armoracpo-[hash]-giquinas-projects.vercel.app`
2. Open browser DevTools → Console
3. Test Sentry by forcing an error:
   ```javascript
   throw new Error("Sentry Test Error - Chrome Claude Deployment Verification");
   ```
4. Go back to Sentry Dashboard: https://sentry.io
5. Navigate to your **armoracpo** project
6. Go to **Issues**
7. Look for the test error (may take 1-2 minutes to appear)

**Expected Outcome:** Error appears in Sentry Issues dashboard with full stack trace.

**If error doesn't appear within 5 minutes:**
- Check browser console for Sentry initialization logs
- Verify REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN is correctly set
- Report issue in documentation

#### 6.2 Test Supabase Connection
1. In the deployed site, try to access a page that requires Supabase (like /login)
2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
3. Look for requests to `jmzvrqwjmlnvxojculee.supabase.co`
4. Check if requests succeed (status 200) or fail with auth errors (401 - expected if not logged in)

**Expected Outcome:** Supabase requests are being made (even if they return 401 for authentication).

**If no Supabase requests:**
- REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL may be incorrect
- Report issue in documentation

#### 6.3 Test Firebase Initialization
1. In browser DevTools → Console, type:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Firebase apps:', window.firebase?.apps?.length || 'Not initialized');
   ```

**Expected Outcome:** Shows "1" or "Firebase apps: 1" (indicating Firebase is initialized).

**If shows "Not initialized" or "0":**
- Firebase environment variables may be incorrect
- Report issue in documentation

#### 6.4 Verify GPS Migration (Supabase)
1. Go back to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Click on **location_history** table
4. Click **"Insert row"** to test insertion (optional)
5. Try inserting a test row:

   - cpo_id: [Leave blank or use a test UUID]
   - latitude: 51.5074
   - longitude: -0.1278
   - accuracy: 10.0
6. If it fails with RLS policy error, that's expected (authentication required)

**Expected Outcome:** Table exists and is accessible (RLS error is normal).

#### 6.5 Check Vercel Deployment Logs
1. In Vercel Dashboard, go to the latest deployment
2. Click on the **"Functions"** or **"Build Logs"** tab
3. Scroll through the build logs
4. Look for any environment variable warnings like:
   - "Warning: REACT_APP_[NAME] is not defined"

**Expected Outcome:** No warnings about missing environment variables.

#### 6.6 Final Verification Checklist
**Check off each item:**

- [ ] Supabase `location_history` table exists and has RLS enabled

## ERROR HANDLING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Can't Log into Dashboard
**Symptoms:** Login fails or access denied
**Solution:**
- Verify you have correct credentials
- Check if 2FA is enabled (may need auth code)
- Try password reset if needed
- Contact project owner for access

#### Issue: SQL Migration Fails
**Symptoms:** Error when running SQL in Supabase
**Solutions:**
- Check if referenced tables exist (protection_assignments, protection_officers)
- Verify you have admin permissions
- Try running each section separately (CREATE TABLE, then indexes, then RLS)
- Document error and skip to next task

#### Issue: Environment Variables Not Saving
**Symptoms:** Variables disappear or show as blank
**Solutions:**
- Ensure all 3 environments are checked (Production, Preview, Development)
- Try using incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser cache and retry
- Try a different browser

#### Issue: Deployment Fails
**Symptoms:** Build fails with errors
**Solutions:**
- Check build logs for specific error
- Verify environment variables are correct (no typos)
- Try redeploying without build cache
- Report to development team if TypeScript errors

#### Issue: Services Not Working After Deployment
**Symptoms:** Sentry/Firebase/Supabase not connecting
**Solutions:**
- Double-check environment variable values (especially DSN and keys)
- Verify variable names have exact prefix: `REACT_APP_`
- Ensure no extra spaces in values
- Redeploy after fixing variables
