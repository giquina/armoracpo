## ‚úÖ Task 5: Production Deployment (COMPLETE)

**What was done:**

  - React Leaflet: 5.0.0 ‚Üí 4.2.1 (React Leaflet v5 requires React 19)
- Committed fixes and pushed to GitHub
- Triggered new Vercel deployment

**Deployment URLs:**
- **Primary**: https://armoracpo.vercel.app
- **Git Branch**: https://armoracpo-git-main-giquinas-projects.vercel.app

**Build Details:**
- **Commit**: 0eec09e (fix: downgrade React to 18.3.1 for CRA compatibility)
- **Previous Commit**: e76dd27 (feat: add comprehensive production deployment tools)
- **Environment**: Production

**Result**: Application deployed to Vercel (pending build completion)

---

## ‚úÖ Task 6: Critical Bug Fix - React Compatibility (COMPLETE)

**Problem Discovered:**
- Create React App 5.0.1 is incompatible with React 19
- Build completed but produced **NO OUTPUT** (empty build directory)
- Only public folder assets copied, no webpack bundling occurred
- Vercel deployment showed 404 errors

**Root Cause:**
- React 19.2.0 has breaking changes not supported by CRA 5.0.1
- React Router 7.9.3 requires React 19 (`use` hook not in React 18)
- React Leaflet 5.0.0 requires React 19
- Build process silently failed during webpack compilation

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Downgraded React to 18.3.1 (latest React 18 LTS)
2. Downgraded React Router to 6.28.0 (latest v6, compatible with React 18)
3. Downgraded React Leaflet to 4.2.1 (compatible with React 18)
4. Updated TypeScript types to match React 18

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` - Updated dependency versions
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with React 18
- Verified build compatibility

**Result**: React 18 is fully supported by Create React App 5.0.1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Create React App Deprecated
- **Issue**: CRA is officially deprecated (February 2025)
- **Current Status**: Still works with React 18
- **Long-term Solution**: Migrate to Vite or Next.js
- **Timeline**: Plan migration in next sprint

### 2. Firebase Engine Warnings
- **Issue**: Firebase packages prefer Node 20+, currently using Node 18
- **Impact**: None - packages work fine with Node 18
- **Solution**: Warnings can be ignored or upgrade to Node 20 in future

### 3. ESLint Warning in App.tsx
- **Issue**: DevPanel import in body of module (line 37)
- **Impact**: Build succeeds with warning
- **Solution**: Move import to top or fix in next update
