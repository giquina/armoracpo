# üîç Armora Infrastructure Analysis - Complete Findings
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Analyst:** Claude (Automated Analysis)
**Purpose:** Document existing infrastructure for ArmoraCPO app development

---

## üìä Executive Summary

The Armora platform already has a **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** backend infrastructure in place for both client and CPO operations. The database schema is comprehensive, Firebase is configured for push notifications, and the architecture is production-ready.

**Key Finding:** The ArmoraCPO app should be a **frontend-only application** that connects to the existing Supabase and Firebase infrastructure. NO new database setup needed!

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Built

### 1. **Supabase Database (Production)**
- **Project:** supabase-emerald-school
- **Environment:** Production
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully operational with comprehensive schema

#### Core CPO Tables:

**`protection_officers` Table:** (3 existing CPO profiles)
- Complete CPO profile management
- SIA license tracking (number, type, expiry)
- Specializations array (Executive Protection, Threat Assessment, etc.)
- Languages spoken
- Protection levels (essential, executive, shadow)
- First aid certification tracking
- Vehicle information
- Hourly rates by protection level
- Availability status
- Performance metrics (ratings, total/completed assignments)

**`protection_assignments` Table:** (1 sample assignment)
- Assignment reference system (ARM-00010001)
- Principal (client) and CPO linking
- Protection levels and assignment types
- Threat level assessment
- Complete address tracking (commencement ‚Üí secure destination)
- Time tracking (scheduled, commenced, completed)
- Financial tracking (quoted vs final service fees)
- Special instructions support
- Assignment status workflow

#### Supporting Tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles (clients and CPOs)
- `assignment_status_history` - Status change tracking
- `emergency_contacts` - Emergency contact management
- `incident_reports` - Incident documentation
- `notifications` - Real-time notifications system
- `payments` - Payment transaction records
- `protection_reviews` - CPO performance reviews
- `subscription_payments` - Recurring payments
- `subscriptions` - Subscription management
- `user_activity_logs` - Activity audit trail

### 2. **Firebase Configuration (armora-protection)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully configured and operational
- **Cloud Messaging API (V1):** Enabled
- **Sender ID:** 1010601153585
- **Service Account:** Configured and managed
- **Web Push Certificates:** Ready to generate for PWA
- **Legacy API:** Disabled (using modern V1 API)

### 3. **Existing Armora Client App**
- **Repository:** github.com/giquina/armora
- **Tech Stack:** React 19.1.1 + TypeScript
- **Features:** Already includes CPO-related services
- **Services:** Assignment management, real-time tracking, notifications

## üéØ **Recommendations for ArmoraCPO App**

### Architecture Approach:
**BUILD:** Separate frontend PWA for CPO operators
**REUSE:** All existing backend infrastructure
**SHARE:** Supabase + Firebase + Stripe integrations

### What ArmoraCPO Needs:

#### 1. **Frontend-Only React App**
```bash
# Initialize with Create React App
npx create-react-app armoracpo --template typescript

# Core dependencies:
- React 19.1.1 + TypeScript
- @supabase/supabase-js (SAME project as client app)
- Firebase SDK (SAME project as client app)
- Stripe Connect for CPO payouts
- Leaflet for GPS/mapping
- React Query for data fetching
```

#### 2. **Environment Variables to Share**
```env
# From existing Armora client app:
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://jmzvrqwjmlnvxojculee.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[from client app]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[from armora-protection]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=armora-protection
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID=1010601153585
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[from client app]
```

#### 3. **CPO-Specific Features to Build**
- **Dashboard:** Active assignments, earnings summary, compliance alerts
- **Job Management:** Accept/decline assignments, view details, navigation
- **Profile Management:** SIA license, vehicle info, availability
- **Earnings:** View payments, generate invoices, track performance
- **Compliance:** SIA license renewal alerts, document management
- **Real-time:** GPS tracking, job notifications, emergency SOS

#### 4. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies to Add**
Currently, some tables may need CPO-specific RLS policies:

```sql
-- Allow CPOs to read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "CPOs can read own profile"
ON protection_officers FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow CPOs to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "CPOs can update own profile"
ON protection_officers FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow CPOs to see assignments assigned to them
CREATE POLICY "CPOs can read assigned assignments"
ON protection_assignments FOR SELECT
USING (cpo_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM protection_officers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
));
```

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (30 minutes)
1. Get Supabase credentials from client app `.env`
2. Get Firebase config from client app
3. Get Stripe keys (need Stripe Connect for CPO payouts)
4. Initialize React TypeScript project
5. Configure environment variables

### Phase 2: Core CPO Features (2-3 days)
1. **Authentication:** Reuse Supabase auth, add CPO role verification
2. **Dashboard:** Display active assignments, earnings, alerts
3. **Job Management:** List available assignments, accept/decline workflow
4. **Profile:** CPO profile with SIA license management
5. **Real-time:** WebSocket connections for job updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
1. **GPS Tracking:** Real-time location updates during assignments
2. **Earnings & Payments:** Stripe Connect integration
3. **Compliance:** SIA license expiry tracking, document uploads
4. **Incident Reporting:** Photo upload, voice notes
5. **Performance Metrics:** Ratings, completion rate, response time

### Phase 4: Deployment & Testing (2-3 days)
1. Deploy to Vercel (separate project from client app)
2. Configure PWA for mobile installation
3. Test end-to-end assignment workflow
4. Security audit and RLS policy review
5. Performance optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use the **SAME** Supabase project as client app
- Use the **SAME** Firebase project as client app
- Share authentication (same user pool)
- Implement proper RLS policies for CPO access
- Use proper SIA terminology throughout
- Design for mobile-first (320px baseline)
- Real-time updates for job assignments

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Create a separate Supabase database
- Rebuild authentication from scratch
- Duplicate backend services
- Use taxi/rideshare terminology
- Allow CPOs to see all client data (security!)
- Skip RLS policy implementation

---

## üìã Required Access

To proceed, you need:
1. ‚úÖ **Supabase Dashboard Access** (already have)
2. ‚úÖ **Firebase Console Access** (already have)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Vercel Team Access** (need to create CPO project)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stripe Account Details** (need Connect for CPO payouts)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **GitHub Repository Access** (need to push CPO code)

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

The ArmoraCPO app will be successful when:
- ‚úÖ CPOs can login with existing Supabase auth
- ‚úÖ CPOs see only their assigned assignments
- ‚úÖ Real-time job notifications work
- ‚úÖ GPS tracking updates during assignments
- ‚úÖ SIA compliance tracking functional
- ‚úÖ Payment/earnings tracking accurate
- ‚úÖ Mobile PWA installable on Android/iOS
- ‚úÖ Performance: <3s load time, 60fps UI
