# 🎯 Armora CPO Project - Current Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** January 3, 2025
**Phase:** Authentication & Security Implementation ✅
**Overall Progress:** 25% (Core Authentication & Database Security Complete)

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. **Authentication System (January 3, 2025)** ✨ NEW

#### **Comprehensive Auth Service**
- **Location:** `/src/services/auth.service.ts` (287 lines)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - ✅ User signup with email/password
  - ✅ CPO profile auto-creation during registration
  - ✅ User signin with session management
  - ✅ Sign out functionality
  - ✅ Profile retrieval (current user + CPO profile)
  - ✅ Profile updates
  - ✅ Password reset via email
  - ✅ Password update
  - ✅ Auth state change listener
- **Integration:** Fully integrated with Supabase Auth and protection_officers table

#### **Environment Configuration Fixed**
- ✅ Real Supabase credentials configured in `.env`
- ✅ Supabase URL: `https://jmzvrqwjmlnvxojculee.supabase.co`
- ✅ Supabase anon key configured (production)
- ✅ Development settings optimized for hot reload

#### **Database Security (RLS Policies)**
- **Location:** `/supabase/migrations/20250103_enable_rls_policies.sql` (944 lines)
- **Status:** ✅ Created, ready for deployment
- **Coverage:**
  - ✅ Protection officers table (CPOs can only access their own data)
  - ✅ Protection assignments table (CPOs see only their assignments + pending jobs)
  - ✅ Payment records (CPOs see only their own payments)
  - ✅ Incident reports (CPOs manage their own, principals can view)
  - ✅ Messages (assignment-based access control)
  - ✅ Reviews (users see reviews about them and by them)
  - ✅ Qualifications, compliance documents, availability
  - ✅ Emergency activations, notifications, profiles
  - ✅ Storage bucket policies (cpo-profiles, compliance-documents, incident-evidence)
- **Helper Functions:**
  - `is_cpo(user_uuid)` - Check if user is a CPO
  - `get_cpo_id(user_uuid)` - Get CPO ID from user ID
  - `is_assignment_principal(user_uuid, assignment_uuid)` - Check principal ownership
  - `is_assignment_cpo(user_uuid, assignment_uuid)` - Check CPO ownership
- **Verification Views:**
  - `rls_status` - Shows RLS enabled/disabled for all tables
  - `rls_policies` - Lists all RLS policies

#### **Test Data for Development**
- **Location:** `/supabase/migrations/20250103_insert_test_data.sql` (783 lines)
- **Status:** ✅ Created, ready for deployment
- **Includes:**
  - 5 test CPOs with varied specializations and ratings
  - 8 test assignments (pending, assigned, active, completed, cancelled)
  - 4 payment records (completed and processing)
  - 2 incident reports (medium and high severity)
  - 5 assignment messages between principals and CPOs
- **Note:** ⚠️ Development/testing only - DO NOT run in production

### 3. **Infrastructure Discovery (MAJOR FINDINGS!)**

#### **✅ Supabase Database (PRODUCTION)**
- **URL:** https://jmzvrqwjmlnvxojculee.supabase.co
- **Project:** supabase-emerald-school
- **Status:** Fully operational with comprehensive schema

**Existing Tables Confirmed:**
- ✅ `protection_officers` (3 CPOs already registered!)
- ✅ `protection_assignments` (1 sample assignment exists)
- ✅ `profiles` (user accounts)
- ✅ `assignment_status_history`
- ✅ `emergency_contacts`
- ✅ `incident_reports`
- ✅ `notifications`
- ✅ `payments`
- ✅ `protection_reviews`
- ✅ `subscriptions`
- ✅ `user_activity_logs`

**Key Discovery:** The database schema is **already built** with CPO-specific tables!

#### **✅ Firebase (PRODUCTION)**
- **Project:** armora-protection
- **Sender ID:** 1010601153585
- **Cloud Messaging:** V1 API enabled
- **Status:** Ready for push notifications

#### **✅ Armora Client App Analysis**
- **Repository:** github.com/giquina/armora
- **Tech Stack:** React 19.1.1 + TypeScript
- **Services:** Assignment, real-time tracking, notifications already built
- **Discovery:** Client app has CPO services integrated!

---

## 🔑 Critical Insights

### **The Game-Changing Discovery:**

**We DO NOT need to build a new database!**

The Armora platform already has:
1. ✅ Complete CPO database schema
2. ✅ 3 registered CPOs in the system
3. ✅ Assignment management infrastructure
4. ✅ Real-time notification system
5. ✅ Firebase push notification setup
6. ✅ Payment processing infrastructure

### **What This Means:**

The ArmoraCPO app should be:
- **Frontend PWA only** (no backend setup needed)
- **Connect to existing Supabase** (same project as client)
- **Use existing Firebase** (same project as client)
- **Share authentication** (same user pool)
- **Extend existing tables** (add CPO-specific features)

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

### **Phase 1: Deploy RLS Policies & Test Data (NEXT - 30 minutes)** ⚡ PRIORITY

```bash
# 1. Deploy RLS policies to Supabase
# Go to: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Run: /supabase/migrations/20250103_enable_rls_policies.sql

# 2. Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT * FROM rls_status;
SELECT * FROM rls_policies;

# 3. Deploy test data (development/staging only!)
# Run: /supabase/migrations/20250103_insert_test_data.sql

# 4. Verify test data
SELECT * FROM protection_officers;
SELECT * FROM protection_assignments;
```

## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### **Potential Blockers:**
1. ⚠️ Missing environment variables from client app
2. ⚠️ Stripe Connect setup for CPO payouts
3. ⚠️ Vercel team access for deployment
4. ⚠️ RLS policies may need adjustment

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Get all credentials upfront (Phase 1)
2. Set up Stripe Connect in parallel
3. Create personal Vercel project first
4. Test RLS policies in development

---

## 📚 Documentation Usage Guide

### **For Implementation (Use These):**
1. **Start:** `00-START-HERE.md` (master index)
2. **Critical:** `INFRASTRUCTURE-FINDINGS.md` (THIS FILE - actual infrastructure)
3. **Build:** `claude.md` (complete implementation guide)
4. **Database:** Connect to existing Supabase (no new setup!)
5. **Tasks:** `todo.md` (but prioritize differently based on findings)

### **For Reference:**
- `react.md` - Code patterns
- `firebase.md` - Push notifications
- `supabase.md` - Database reference (but schema already exists!)
- `cli-reference.md` - Command quick reference

---

## ✅ Action Items for Tomorrow

### **Priority 1 (MUST DO):**
1. [ ] Get `.env` file from Armora client app repository
2. [ ] Initialize React TypeScript project
3. [ ] Set up Supabase client with existing credentials
4. [ ] Test connection to production database
5. [ ] Query existing CPO profiles to verify access

### **Priority 2 (SHOULD DO):**
1. [ ] Set up Firebase SDK
2. [ ] Implement basic authentication
3. [ ] Create login screen
4. [ ] Test login with existing CPO account

### **Priority 3 (NICE TO HAVE):**
1. [ ] Set up Vercel project
2. [ ] Configure PWA manifest
3. [ ] Plan first sprint (dashboard)
